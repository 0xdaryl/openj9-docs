# Eclipse OpenJ9

Welcome to the user documentation for the Eclipse OpenJ9 virtual machine (VM).

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">Note</span> **Note:** Documentation to support OpenJ9 is still under construction. The current content covers the command-line options and environment variables that you can use to configure the VM when you start your application, plus some diagnostic tools. We expect further content to be contributed over time. Because OpenJ9 was contributed to the Eclipse Foundation by IBM, this content contains some links to additional information that forms part of the <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> [IBM<sup>&reg;</sup> SDK, Java<sup>&trade;</sup> Technology Edition product documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2/welcome_javasdk_family.html) in IBM Knowledge Center. That content supplements the documentation here until a more complete set of user documentation is available. (The <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> symbol is used to indicate external links.)

This user documentation supports the configuration, tuning, and diagnosis of the OpenJ9 VM in an OpenJDK version 8 or OpenJDK version 9 runtime. However, due to differences between the Java SE 8 and 9 class libraries, specific options might apply only to one environment. Icons are used to indicate where differences apply. For example:

![Start of content that applies only to Java 8 (LTS)](cr/java8.png) This sentence applies only to Java 8 binaries that include the OpenJ9 VM. ![End of content that applies only to Java 8 (LTS)](cr/java_close_lts.png)

![Start of content that applies only to Java 9 and later](cr/java9plus.png) This sentence applies only to Java 9 or later binaries that include the OpenJ9 VM. ![End of content that applies only to Java 9 or later](cr/java_close.png)

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">Note</span> **Note:** As a usability aid, the icons for long term service (LTS) releases are a different colour from feature releases.

The following table indicates which Java releases are LTS releases and which are feature releases:

| Java SE version | LTS release                                                                    | Feature release                                                                    |
|-----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|

We welcome contributions to the user documentation. If you would like to get involved, please read our [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What is OpenJ9

OpenJ9 is a high performance, scalable, Javaâ„¢ virtual machine (VM) implementation that is fully compliant with the [Java Virtual Machine Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/index.html).

At run time, the VM interprets the Java bytecode that is compiled by the Java compiler. The VM acts as a translator between the language and the underlying operating system and hardware. A Java program requires a specific VM to run on a particular platform, such as Linux<sup>&trade;</sup>, z/OS<sup>&reg;</sup>, or Windows<sup>&trade;</sup>.

This reference material provides information about the VM configuration and tuning options, together with the default settings.

## Configuring your system

For normal operation, certain environment variables must be set at the operating system level. Depending on your system environment, you might also want to set other configuration options that allow the VM to exploit hardware and operating system features. Read <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Customizing your system](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.vm.80.doc/docs/j9_configure.html) to learn more about the following options:

- Setting the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variable.
- Setting the LIBPATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (AIX<sup>&reg;</sup> and Linux).
- Setting ulimits on AIX and Linux systems to ensure that the operating system allocates sufficient resources for your application.
- Setting region size, BPXPRM parameters, and Language Environment<sup>&reg;</sup> runtime options on z/OS systems.
- If your application allocates a large amount of memory and frequently accesses that memory, you might want to enable large page support on your system. See <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Configuring large page memory allocation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.vm.80.doc/docs/j9_configure_large_page.html).
- Configuring Dynamic LPAR support on AIX systems.

## Performance tuning

OpenJ9 is configured to start with a set of default options that provide the optimal runtime environment for Java applications with typical workloads. However, if your application is atypical, you can improve performance by tuning the OpenJ9 VM. You can also improve performance by enabling hardware features or using specific APIs in your application code. Click the links to learn more about the following options:

Choosing a garbage collection policy
: J9 includes several garbage collection policies. To learn more about these policies and the types of application workload that can benefit from them, see <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Specifying a garbage collection policy](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.vm.80.doc/docs/mm_gc_specify.html).

Improving startup times with class data sharing
: You can share class data between running VMs, which can reduce the startup time for a VM once the cache has been created. For more information, see <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Class data sharing between VMs](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.vm.80.doc/docs/shrc_intro.html).



<!-- These features not yet available in OpenJDK class libaries

Using hardware compression acceleration devices
: J9 can exploit hardware compression devices to reduce CPU consumption and shorten processing times.
- For AIX and Linux systems, see Enabling hardware compression acceleration.
- For IBM zEnterprise<sup>&reg;</sup> systems, see zEnterprise Data Compression.

Exploiting Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)
: High performance network infrastructure that supports Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is designed to speed up communications between applications. : On Linux systems, existing Java socket applications can take advantage of RDMA-capable network adapters by using extensions to the Socket and ServerSocket APIs. For more information, see Java Sockets over Remote Direct Memory Access. Alternatively, you can write applications that use APIs in the jVerbs library to communicate directly over RDMA-capable infrastructure. See The jVerbs library.
-  On z/OS systems, J9 supports the use of the SMC-R protocol solution to enable TCP socket applications to transparently use RDMA. For more information, see Shared Memory Communication via RDMA.

Exploiting Graphics Processing Units (GPU)
: On Linux and Windows systems, you can improve the performance of your Java applications by offloading certain processing functions from your processor (CPU) to a graphics processing unit. For more information, see Exploiting Graphics Processing Units.-->

Native data
: If your Java application manipulates native data, consider writing your application to take advantage of methods in the Data Access Accelerator API.

Cloud optimizations
: When running applications on most cloud services, a smaller footprint can generate cost savings. OpenJ9 provides a tuning mechanism that detects when the VM is idle, releasing free memory pages to keep the footprint as small as possible and keep your running costs to a minimum. For more information, see [-XX:IdleTuningMinIdleWaitTime](xxidletuningminidlewaittime.md).

## Runtime options

Runtime options are specified on the command line and include system properties, standard options, nonstandard (**-X**) options, and **-XX** options. For a detailed list of runtime options, see [OpenJ9 command-line options](cmdline_specifying.md)

## Default settings

If you do not specify any options on the command line at run time, the OpenJ9 VM starts with default settings that define how it operates. For more information about these settings, see [Default settings for the OpenJ9 VM](openj9_defaults.md).

## Troubleshooting

The OpenJ9 diagnostic component contains extensive features to assist with problem determination. Diagnostic data is produced under default conditions, but can also be controlled by starting the VM with the [-Xdump option](xdump.md). You can also trace Java applications, methods, and VM operations by using the [-Xtrace option](xtrace.md).

A number of cross-platform tools are available to help you diagnose problems.

To learn more, read <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Diagnostic tools and data](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.vm.80.doc/docs/diag_tools_intro.html).
